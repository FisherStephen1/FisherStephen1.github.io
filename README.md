## Welcome to Stephen Fisher's Page

I am curretnly learning how to use GitHub and will be using this page as I learn and to post data science projects. Although my major is Computer Engineering, I have a deep interest in coding and data and am excited to learn more about both.  I hope to be able to apply the skills I learn to projects that I am passionate about.

One of the related field that I am most interested in are sports analytics.  Recently, there has been a big shift in sports leading to teams following the recommendations of data, rather than gut feeling.  There is still a lot more to be learned from data that can have huge impacts in sports. This can also be used to help keep players safer.
